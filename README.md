# PersonalPortfolio
## About 
Provides a live website, which will act as a portfolio to showcase my web development projects.
The website will give a (brief) text description about me, images + links to my projects, and contact information. The goal is a clean-looking, concise page, not trying to cram information (work history, job summaries, school, etc). More information/detail is available in resume as well as project folders.
